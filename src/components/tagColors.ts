/**
 * v5 #08/#09: the spirit tile's colour scheme, decided via `/prototype` (variants A-H,
 * screenshots in `.scratch/v5/screenshots-08/`). Two axes, two different treatments,
 * deliberately separated from `tierColors.ts`'s bright pastel rainbow (`#c078c0`..`#ff7878`) by
 * lightness and saturation - these are darker and more saturated everywhere, even where a hue
 * lands near a tier hue (e.g. `fast-tempo` and the tier palette's magenta) - so a spirit chip
 * can never be mistaken for a tier badge. If either palette is ever brightened independently,
 * re-check the near-hue pairs for a genuine collision, not just this comment's claim.
 *
 * - Expansion: categorical (7 values) - muted, deep "jewel tone" hues, one per canonical
 *   expansion name. Used on both the tile's left-edge stripe and its solid expansion chip -
 *   same value in both places, verified byte-identical, so the two reinforce one signal.
 * - Playstyle tags: categorical, open-ish (11 seen today) - a distinct, saturated palette, one
 *   explicit colour per known tag (a hash-based palette with fewer slots than tags caused real
 *   collisions in the first prototype round - two different tags rendering identically defeats
 *   the point of colour-coding). The hash fallback only fires for a future tag added here later.
 *
 * Complexity does not get a colour - it's ordinal, shown as a dot meter (●●○○) plus its own
 * name as text (the "effort level" idiom), not a hue.

 * panel-theming #02→#03: the owner picked variant C — a dark translation of the printed spirit
 * panels' palette, keeping #23's vertical OCFDU bars retinted. This is the spirit detail modal's
 * default surface palette. Sampled/proposed off the panel scans the repo hosts (provenance:
 * `.scratch/panel-theming/panel-vibe-sheet.md`, ticket #01) — `text`/`accent` are sampled hexes,
 * the umber `surface`/`raised`/`edge` are the vibe sheet's proposed dark-translations of the
 * parchment. Presentation only, not game data, so no canon tripwire (the round recorded
 * provenance instead).
 *
 * Lives here as the modal's one colour source — applied as inline CSS custom properties on the
 * modal root (`SpiritDetail`) and consumed by the `.modal.spirit-detail` rules in `deck.css`,
 * the same colour-from-map idiom the chip systems use. `cardChipColors.test.ts` pins it apart
 * from every other chip/band palette, byte-for-byte, so a panel colour can never be mistaken for
 * a tier, tag, expansion, kind/speed, or difficulty-band colour.
 *
 * Provenance per the vibe sheet: `text`/`accent` are sampled hexes; the umber `surface`/`raised`/
 * `edge` and the `body` brown are the sheet's *proposed dark-translations* (design judgment for a
 * dark theme, not sampled) — labelled honestly so a judgment value never reads as sampled data.
